	abstract = {Many proteins{\textquoteright} biological functions rely on interconversions between multiple conformations occurring at micro- to millisecond (μs-ms) timescales. A lack of standardized, large-scale experimental data has hindered obtaining a more predictive understanding of these motions. After curating \&gt;100 Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) relaxation datasets, we realized an observable for μs-ms motion was hiding in plain sight. Millisecond motions can cause NMR signals to broaden beyond detection, leaving some residues not assigned in the chemical shift datasets of ~10,000 proteins deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB). We made the bold assumption that residues missing assignments are exchange-broadened due to μs-ms motions, and trained various deep learning models to predict missing assignments as markers for such dynamics. Strikingly, these models also predict μs-ms motion directly measured in NMR relaxation experiments. The best of these models, which we named Dyna-1, leverages an intermediate layer of the multimodal language model ESM-3. Notably, dynamics directly linked to biological function{\textemdash}including enzyme catalysis and ligand binding{\textemdash}are particularly well predicted by Dyna-1, which parallels our findings that residues with μs-ms motions are highly conserved. We anticipate the datasets and models presented here will be transformative in unlocking the common language of dynamics and function.Competing Interest StatementD.K. is a co-founder of Relay Therapeutics and MOMA Therapeutics.
